# ⚖️ USCIS Case Status Tracker

A privacy-first, single-page web application that parses and visualizes USCIS ELIS API JSON data — transforming raw case records into a rich, human-readable timeline with intelligent event interpretation, progress tracking, and comprehensive case analysis.

> **100% client-side** — No servers, no databases, no data transmission. All processing happens entirely in your browser.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Case Data Parsing
- Upload a `.json` file or paste raw USCIS API JSON directly
- Automatic validation and error handling for malformed or non-USCIS data
- Supports the full USCIS ELIS API response structure

### 📋 Case Details Dashboard
- **Application Information** — Receipt number, form type, form name, applicant name, filing date, last updated, filing channel
- **Case Flags & Status** — Real-time badges for case status (open/closed), adjudicator acknowledgment, premium processing, group status, travel authorization, action required, and evidence requests

### 📅 Event Timeline
- Chronological timeline of all USCIS system events, sorted newest → oldest
- **60+ event codes** decoded with human-readable names and detailed descriptions based on the [NIEM v5.0](https://niem.github.io/model/5.0/scr/BenefitDocumentStatusCategoryCodeSimpleType/) `scr:BenefitDocumentStatusCategoryCodeSimpleType` schema
- Color-coded categories: Receipt, Background Checks, Interview, Processing, Holds, Approved, Denied, Green Card, RFE, Closed
- **Submission date** displayed in UTC (Zulu time) — fixed filing date regardless of timezone
- **All other events** displayed based on `createdAtTimestamp` with original `eventDateTime` shown in the selected timezone for reference
- **Silent Case Update** detection — identifies when USCIS updates the case record without a formal event code (officer touch)

### 📊 Case Summary & Analysis
- Intelligent narrative generation based on case stage (filing → receipt → background checks → interview → post-interview → decision)
- **Adjudication Progress Bar** — Visual step tracker showing exactly where your case stands
- Key statistics: days since filing, total system events, official notices
- Context-aware messaging for approved, denied, RFE, post-interview, and interview-scheduled cases
- Action-required alerts

### 📬 Official Notices
- Parsed display of all USCIS notices with generation dates
- Interview appointment date/time extraction

### 🌐 Timezone Support
- **Default: Central Time (CT) — CST/CDT** — No location permission prompts
- Full US timezone support via dropdown selector:
  - Continental: Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific
  - Non-Continental: Alaska, Hawaii-Aleutian, Hawaii
  - Territories: Puerto Rico (Atlantic), Guam (Chamorro), American Samoa
- All timestamps (except fixed UTC submission date) convert dynamically when timezone is changed

### 🎨 Theme System
- **Dark mode** (default) and **Light mode** with smooth transitions
- **Auto mode** — Switches between dark/light based on sunrise/sunset (uses device geolocation if permitted, otherwise defaults to 7 AM – 7 PM)
- Theme preference persisted in `localStorage`

### 📱 Fully Responsive
- Optimized layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Date **and** time visible on all device sizes in the event timeline
